# 8th-and-9th-Grade-Khan-Academy-HTML-CSS-and-Javascript-Projects
This is all the code for the projects that I made on KhanAcademy Wtih HTML, CSS, and Javacript.
DISCLAIMER: Because a lot of this code uses specific Khan Academy Files and API, it is only guaranteed to work on Khan Academy. 
You can try to use it on other sites or API, but for a lot of the code, errors are likely to occur for the reasons stated above.
